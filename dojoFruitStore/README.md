# Dojo Fruit Store
* Coding Dojo Assignment: Building a Small Web App (Flask, Jinja2, Template Rendering, Routes, Redirects, posts)

# Objectives:
* Practice using git (particularly git clone)
* Get more comfortable with POST and passing information via a form
* Understand how to reference static css or images
* Note the importance of making your key assignments/projects look better
* Understand why rendering HTML on a URL that received a POST is a bad idea

# Tasks:
* For this assignment, you'll be building a small web app

* Start by cloning the repo found here: https://github.com/mchoidojo/dojo_fruit_store

* Note that the template allows you to use simple if statements and for loops, but is not really a place to do much more than that. If you're wanting to do any calculations, you would want to do this in the routing file (server.py).

* Also, remember that all form inputs are received as strings. If you want to work with them as numbers, use the int() method to convert a string to an integer.

* Display all the provided images of fruit on the fruits.html page

* When the Checkout button is clicked, have the correct information display on the checkout.html page

* In the checkout method, add a print statement that says "Charging {{Customer name}} for {{count}} fruits"

* While on the checkout screen, hit the refresh button in your browser. Then check your terminal--what do you notice?
