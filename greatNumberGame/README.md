# Great Number Game

- Coding Dojo Assignment: Web Applications (Flask, Jinja2, Routing, Template Rendering, Request, Session)

# Objectives:

- Practice using session to store data about a client's history with the web app
- Practice clearing a session
- Practice having the server use data submitted by a client with a form

# Task:

- Create a new Flask project called great_number_game

- In the root route, save a random number between 1 and 100 and display a form for the user to guess the number

- Create a route that determines whether the number submitted is too high, too low, or correct. Show this status on the HTML page.

- NINJA BONUS: Display the results as shown in the wireframe (i.e. with appropriate colors and positioning)

- NINJA BONUS: Allow the user to keep guessing until they get it correct

- NINJA BONUS: Let the user know how many attempts they took before guessing the correct number

- SENSEI BONUS: Only allow the user to guess up to 5 times. If they don't guess it on their 5th attempt, display a "You Lose" message and allow them to try again.

- SENSEI BONUS: If they win, allow the user to submit their name. Have a link to a leaderboard page that shows winners' names and how many attempts they took to guess correctly.
